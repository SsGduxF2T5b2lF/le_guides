# Le Sharing Le Session ## Testing - pytest
Testing library, general ideas

---

# SOURCE - TO READ
## 1. [Pytest Documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/), duh
  
# Optional, following from previous sharing sesions
## [PyPA Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
## [THE Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages)

---

# The Why, because:
1. You have `expectation` for what you code
2. There's multiple aspects to test
3. Resilience, one change in one part doesn't break other parts. Regardless technical skill.

---

# The overal experience will be,
## for development, testing
1. Write your package -> the `*.py` file
2. Write test case -> the `test_*.py` file
3. Run `pytest`

## final product, production
You don't test on production / delivery

---

# How test cases are written?
## Anatomy
Test anatomy are expalined on [this link](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/explanation/anatomy.html)
```
https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/explanation/anatomy.html
```

In general, each test case should
- Arrange
- Act
- Assert
- Cleanup

Or more like
- Setup: import stuffs, setup database, generate token or random stuffs, etc
- Execute: confirming that given input A, my stuffs will do B as expected
- eXit: drop table, reset sequence, etc. So other tests didn't affected

## pytest.fixture?
Fancy way to Setup tbh. So you don't have to write too much stuff on test.

---

## Initial
```
. <repo dir>
|
|_ mycalc/
| |__ __init__.py
| |__ mycalc.py
|
|_ tests/
  |__ test_sum.py
  |__ test_div.py
```

```python
# mycalc.py
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b

def div(a, b):
    return a / b
```

---

## Create test

```python
# test_sum.py

from mycalc import sum, TWO

def test_sum_success():
  input1 = 2
  input2 = TWO
  four = sum(input1, input2)
  assert four == input1 + input2
```

```python
# test_div.py

from mycalc import div, TWO

def test_div_success():
  input1 = 2
  input2 = TWO
  one = div(input1, input2)
  assert one == input1 / input2
```

---

# Source code or build version, which one should we test?
- both are valid, it's just on a different scope. Usually
  - source code for unit test
  - build version to test further scope, i.e integration test, stress test, etc

## You can test with several helpers
- CI/CD, as you might have seen in GPR_BE repo
  - For each pull request / new commit
      - Build in many os [win | linux]
      - Build in many arch [32 | 64]
      - Optional, build in many python3 version
          
- Hook-like mechanism, like GIT Hooks, where you can set your machine to run `pytest` before doing said action, for example
  - Git hooks: each time you `git commit`
  - VSCode: run test on save with [this feature(?)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing#_test-discovery)

# LE SECRET BOSS
## Testing - pytest
Testing library, GPR_BE use-case

---

# Get yourself ready with this stuff
## 1. GPR_BE with submodules
Submodule is just a way git creating link/shortcut to other repo with commitID tracking.
We have `geoprosp_database` and `geoprosp_stage` as submodules.
Get yourself git submodule cheatsheet. This [is mine](https://gist.github.com/thejatmik/ba36fc7b312f5552af3f94ff8ed6665f).

## 2. Database connection
- Docker container, or install postgresql server
- Set config `instance`
  - `config.py` for flask app development
  - `test_config.py` for pytest test client
      
- Please don't mixup config instance for development and testing, since in testing there's a lot of drop query.
      
- How to configure and start test? See `Run pytest` on `GPR_BE/.github/workflows/workflows-test*.yml`
