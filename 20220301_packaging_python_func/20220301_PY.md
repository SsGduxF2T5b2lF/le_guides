# Packaging Python Function
Simple setup for local python package

---

# SOURCE - TO READ
## 1. [PyPA Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
## 2. [THE Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages)
## 3. [PyPA Sample Package](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject)

---

# The Why
1. Developing / testing,
2. Closed source,
3. etc

---

# The overal experience will be,
## for development, testing
1. Write the source code  -> the `*.py` file
2. Install the source code -> `pip install directory/where/setup/located/`

## final product, production
1. Write the source code  -> the `*.py` file
2. Build with setup tools -> the `*.whl` file
3. Install the wheel file, `pip install package.whl`

# Case: a function + constants

---

## Initial, your script
```
.
|_ mypackage/
  |
  |__ mycalc.py
  |__ using_mycalc_here.py
```

```python
# mycalc.py
def sum(a, b):
    return a + b

def div(a, b):
    return a / b

TWO = 2
```

```python
# using_mycalc_here.py

from mycalc import sum, div, TWO

four = sum(2, TWO)

sixtynine = div(138, TWO)

print(four, sixtynine)
```

---

## __init__.py as a package constructor, leave it empty
can be used to work like `index.js`
```
.
|_ mypackage/
| |
| |__ mycalc.py
| |__ __init__.py
|
|_ using_mycalc_here.py
```

```python
# using_mycalc_here.py

from mypackage import mycalc

four = mycalc.sum(2, mycalc.TWO)

sixtynine = mycalc.div(138, mycalc.TWO)

print(four, sixtynine)
```

---

## Create build setup
### 1. Move `mycalc.py` and `__init__.py` to `src/mycalc/*`
### 2. Add `pyproject.toml`
### 3. Add `setup.py` or `setup.cfg`

For step 2 and 3 follow pypa user guidance or see pypa sample package repo
```
.
|_ mypackage/
  |
  |_ src/
  | |_ mycalc/
  |   |__ mycalc.py
  |   |__ __init__.py
  |
  |_ pyproject.toml
  |_ setup.py
```

Now we can build the package into wheel file
```
$ cd mypackage/
$ python3 -m build
$ pip install dist/package_name.whl
```
or install directly, wheel file will be created temporary
```
$ pip install mypackage/
```

see your installed package with `pip list` or `pip freeze`
should be listed as `package_name=0.0.1`

# Why not build instead?
- still developing
- the build will only available for one specific version of python, os, and architecture

## You can build with several helpers
- Makefile + multiple version of python
- CI/CD
  - For each pull request / new commit
      - Build in many os [win | linux]
      - Build in many arch [32 | 64]
      - Optional, build in many python3 version
  optional because it might equivalent build only once with version `>3.6`

# Boilerplate & Helpers

## [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
    Supports several templates for many purposes. Templates could include your desired feature/package to use in development.
